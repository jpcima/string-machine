# string-machine

This is a virtual-analog string ensemble synthesizer.

This implementation is based on a digital model designed by Peter Whiting.
The improvement of the model adds various abilities, in particular a virtual-analog emulation of the bucket brigade delay circuit.

- implemented the bucket brigade delay
- provided two switchable chorus models, digital and BBD
- provided the Solina chorus as independent plugins, 1-in 2-out and 2-in 2-out
- supported dynamic changes of sample rate
- added support of MIDI controllers: volume, pan, expression

**0.1.0**

- initial release
